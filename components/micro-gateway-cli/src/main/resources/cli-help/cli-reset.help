NAME
     micro-gw help reset - resets all the previously specified configurations.

SYNOPSIS
     micro-gw reset [-c|--config]

DESCRIPTION
    
     The reset command is used to clear all the previously specified configurations, such as "--server-url", "--username",
      etc.
     
     When running the setup command for the first time, those configurations are stored internally within the microgateway
     CLI tool and will be reused for subsequent setup commands. To rerun the setup command with a new set of configurations,
     the reset command needs to be run beforehand.
     
     Using "micro-gw reset -c <config-file>", we can reset an externally provided config file. 

EXAMPLES
    Reset all the configuration to default.
    $ micro-gw reset
    
    Reset an external config file
    $ micro-gw reset -c /home/user/micro-gw/external-config.toml
